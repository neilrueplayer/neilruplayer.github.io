> "The unknown thing to be known appeared to me as some stretch of earth or hard marl, resisting penetration... the sea advances insensibly in silence, nothing seems to happen, nothing moves, and the water is so far off you can hardly hear it... yet it finally surrounds the resistant substance." — A. Grothendieck

I am a mathematician operating within the computational domain. Born in Durban, I was formed in the rigorous structuralist tradition of Université of Paris, before seeking a quieter vantage point here in the hills of Shillong.

My work stands at the intersection of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) and Computer Vision. While the current industry trend views Neural Networks as statistical black boxes to be optimized for yield, I view them as geometric flows seeking equilibrium. I am a student of the Grothendieck school of thought: I believe that we should not force a problem open with a hammer (computing power), but rather let it dissolve in the rising sea of understanding (mathematical structure).
